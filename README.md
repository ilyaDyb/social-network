This is my social-network something like facebook or VK, but have less functions because i'm writing the code alone.
If you want to start project:
1. Create workdir and write: <b>git clone https://github.com/ilyaDyb/social-network.git</b>
2. Then: <b style="text-decoration: underline;">cd social-network/</b> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">docker-compose up</span>
3. !You should use python-dotenv for token (create file ".env" in workdir and write: REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<paste-your-token-here>). (You can get it after authorization on https://replicate.com/) #this will be install automatically in future

But you wonâ€™t be able to see all the beauty of the application without test users without any activities (created posts, changed the avatar, etc.)


If you are a recruiter and you are interested in me along with my project, please call or write, I can show all the functionality and explain why I used something here or somewhere else.
